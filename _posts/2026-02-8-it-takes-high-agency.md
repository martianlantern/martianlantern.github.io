It takes very high agency
- To realize when you are in the wrong place
- To realize the world is drifting apart from the old rules and new rules are being written, the old rules which you learned no longer apply
- To realize the rewards tremendously outweigh the costs of consistently putting efforts on updating your mental models
- To realize that people don’t act with incentives as much as they think
- To see the world with clarity and take it as it is and act on it
- Games of money, power, hierarchies are not worth playing and avoid people who are playing them
- Conviction is a hell of power drug, it makes you do things that you would never do otherwise
