It takes very high agency
- To realize when you are not in the right place
- To realize the world is drifting apart from the old rules and new rules are being written, the old rules which you learned no longer apply
- It pays off to consistently put efforts to update your mental models
- To realize people don’t act with incentives as much as they think
- To see the world with clarity and act on it
- Games of money, power, hierarchy are not worth playing and avoid people who are playing them
- Conviction is a hell of power drug, it makes you do things that you would never do otherwise

I know I will continue building things that I am proud of and putting my name on and my peers, colleagues, people who call me friends, and close ones are proud of using and recommending. All other things are just thin desires

There are a lot of things that I haven't figured out yet in life, but I am very confident with the system and frameworks that I have put in place it is only a matter of time, until then I am stuck in local optima
