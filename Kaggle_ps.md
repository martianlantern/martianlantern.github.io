# Google DeepMind - Vibe Code with Gemini 3 Pro in AI Studio
Build with Gemini 3 and compete for $500,000 in credits

## Overview
Join us for a Vibe Coding sprint. Use Gemini 3 Pro's advanced reasoning and native multimodality to turn natural prompts into working, complex applications in Google AI Studio.

From December 5th to 12th, vibe code the next generation of AI-powered applications that solve complex real-world problems in Google AI Studio, share them with the community, and bring your ideas to life.

## Description
Imagine building an application that finally solves a daily frustration or addresses a global challenge that has been waiting for an AI breakthrough. This Vibe Coding with Gemini 3 Pro Hackathon challenges you to step up and use the latest advancements in AI to do exactly that.

Harness Gemini's advanced reasoning capabilities and native multimodality to bridge the gap between idea and reality. You are tasked with building solutions that were impossible to build yesterday, like solving everyday personal friction points to tackling complex global challenges.

## Getting Started in AI Studio

Google AI Studio is a platform for building with Google's Gemini models. The two main components are:

Playground: Here, you can try different models and their capabilities
Build: Here, you can vibe code products, mix-and-match different AI-powered apps, and more!
For this hackathon, you'll bring your ideas to life in Google AI Studio Build building with Gemini 3. Once you enter your idea, an AI studio coding environment window will open. This is where you can preview your app, the code and make changes.

If you want to learn more about AI Studio Build features, you can look at the following videos:

AI Studio Build uses Gemini 3 Pro Preview by default, so just go to the Build tab and get started!

## Submission Requirements
Please read carefully. Projects that do not follow these formatting rules will not be eligible for prizes.

A valid submission must contain a Kaggle Writeup, which includes:

- Kaggle Writeup
- Attached Video Demo
- Attached Public AI Studio App Link
To create a new Writeup, click on the "New Writeup" button here. After you have saved your Writeup, you should see a "Submit" button in the top right corner.

Your final Submission must be made prior to the deadline. Any un-submitted or draft Writeups by the competition deadline will not be considered by the Judges.

Note: If you attach a private Kaggle Resource to your public Kaggle Writeup, your private Resource will automatically be made public after the deadline.

All of the content on Kaggle is written in Markdown. If you are copy-pasting from another application, like Word or your browser, you may need to clean up the markdown or html for things to display properly.

1. Kaggle Writeup
The Kaggle Writeup serves as your project report. This should include a summary of what you are submitting, how you created it with links to the AI Studio app, and why it's important and the impact you are creating. You must select a track for your Writeup and include a title, subtitle and thumbnail image in order to submit.

The Project Description should not exceed 250 words. Submissions over this limit may be subject to penalty.

The below assets must be attached to the Writeup to be eligible.

a. Video Demo
An engaging video demonstrating your project in action.

Length: Maximum 2 minutes.
Visibility: It must be posted publicly (YouTube, X/Twitter, Loom, etc.) and a direct link attached to the Writeup.
Access: It must be viewable by the judges without requiring a login.
Licensing: All materials used in your video must be permitted for re-distribution and publication and you warrant you have the right to use the content included in your video.
Note: If the uploaded video is longer than 2min, only the first two minutes will be reviewed. Make your impact early.

b. Public AI Studio App Link
This is the working app, the interactive demo. This allows judges to experience your project firsthand.

Instructions:

Once you enter your idea in AI Studio apps under Build, an AI studio coding environment window will open. This is where you can preview your app, the code and make changes.

When you're done vibe coding and ready to submit, go to the top right corner of the coding environment and click "Save".

Then click "Share app". A pop up window will appear. Enable "Publish your app" and "Default to full screen". This step is mandatory.

Copy the link (this is your interactive demo link) and attach it as a Project Link in your Writeup.

Access: All links must be publicly accessible and not require a login or paywall.

## Evaluation

Show, don't just tell. Your project will be judged primarily on your video demo and the app that you create. This is your chance to create something exciting and compelling. Judges want to see the "wow" factor. Your video should tell a story, demonstrate the real-world impact of your app and leave the judges inspired by the technical skill and implementation of Gemini's latest capabilities and native multimodality.

### Judging Criteria:

Your video demo will be the primary lens through which judges evaluate your project, with your Writeup and application serving as verification and providing technical depth. Submissions will be scored based on the following criteria:

Impact (40%): Does the application solve a real-world problem? Is the vision inspiring and does the solution have a tangible potential for positive change?

Technical Depth & Execution (30%): Does the application work? How effectively does it utilize Gemini 3's advanced capabilities (multimodality, reasoning, context)? Is the technology real, functional, well-engineered, and not just faked for the demo?

Creativity (20%): How original is the idea? Does it leverage Gemini 3 in a way that wasn't previously possible? How many of Gemini 3's capabilities are you using and how well do they work together? Did you use Gemini 3 in new ways?

Presentation Quality (10%): How exciting, engaging, and well-produced is the video? Does it tell a powerful story that captures the viewer's imagination? Does it clearly and effectively demonstrate the product in action, showcasing a great user experience? Does it have viral potential?
