## Experience

**Sprinklr** — Machine Learning Engineer  
*Gurugram, India* | Aug 2025 – Present

Building production ML infrastructure for real-time voice AI. Architected and deployed optimized speech-to-text pipelines using vLLM, achieving significant latency improvements. Designed a custom vLLM scheduler for priority-based request routing in STT workloads, now running in production. Currently leading development of end-to-end voice bots for real-time conversational AI.

**Aalto Vision Lab** — Research Assistant  
*Helsinki, Finland* | Jan 2025 – Jun 2025

Worked under [Matias Turkulainen](https://maturk.github.io/) and [Juho Kannala](https://users.aalto.fi/~kannalj1/) on 3D reconstruction. Built distributed training infrastructure for Gaussian Splatting using SLURM. Conducted systematic benchmarking and ablation studies across Gaussian Splatting pipelines to identify performance bottlenecks.

**Sprinklr** — Product Intern  
*Gurugram, India* | May 2024 – Jul 2024

Evaluated unified speech-to-speech models against traditional STT→LLM→TTS pipelines. Benchmarked open-source and proprietary models across latency, quality, and cost dimensions. Delivered a cost-effective solution competitive with closed-source alternatives, influencing the team's voice AI roadmap.

**Technical University of Munich** — Research Intern  
*Munich, Germany* | Jun 2023 – Jul 2023

Researched system identification and deep RL for quadruped robot control under Hongpeng Cao and Marco Caccamo. Developed simulation models capturing robot dynamics and uncertainties. Compared MPC with learned system models against model-free deep RL approaches for robust locomotion.

**Hexo AI** — ML Intern  
*Remote* | Feb 2023 – Apr 2023

Built text-conditional latent diffusion models for product photography generation. Implemented image inpainting with textual conditioning from scratch. Delivered production-ready models as part of a 3-person team.

**64Squares** — ML Intern  
*Remote* | Dec 2022 – Jan 2023

Developed contextual AI chatbots for B2B applications. Trained BERT and spaCy models with DIET classifier for intent and entity recognition. Built evaluation pipelines for stress testing and improving model resilience.
