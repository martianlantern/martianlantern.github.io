Building production ML infrastructure for real-time voice AI. Architected and deployed optimized speech-to-text pipelines using vLLM with significant latency improvements. Designed a custom vLLM scheduler for priority-based request routing in STT workloads, now running in production. Currently leading development of end-to-end voice bots for real-time conversational AI.

Parallel reasoning framework for LLMs. Implements multiple strategies—DeepConf (confidence-gated filtering), Self-Consistency (majority voting), Debate (multi-agent discussion), Tree of Thoughts (tree search), and Graph reasoning—all running in parallel with configurable compute budgets. Supports local models via Transformers/vLLM and external APIs. Used for mathematical reasoning and complex problem solving.
